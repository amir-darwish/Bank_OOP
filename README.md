# 🏦 Bank Management System in C++

This is a fully functional **Bank Management System** developed entirely from scratch using **C++**, with no AI assistance and no external libraries — just core C++ features and the STL (`vector`, `fstream`).

## 🎯 Project Objective

The main goal of this project is to apply Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles and professional software design practices (like SOLID) in a real-world simulation. This project was built for learning, improving my architecture thinking, and writing reusable and maintainable code.

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

- ✅ Developed 100% manually — no AI tools or code generation
- 🧱 ~30 well-structured classes based on the **Single Responsibility Principle**
- 🧠 Applied core OOP concepts:
  - Encapsulation
  - Inheritance
  - Polymorphism
  - Abstraction
  - Method Overloading & Overriding
- 🔐 Manual password encryption (no built-in or external functions)
- 🚫 Login protection (lock system after 3 failed attempts)
- 💾 Data persistence using `.txt` files (no database)
- 👨‍💼 Full admin management with bitmask-based permission control
- 🔁 Reusable custom utility libraries

## 📚 Custom Libraries Used

These libraries were developed by me in prior training sessions and reused here to write clean, modular, and reusable code:

- `String.h` – String manipulation functions  
- `Date.h` – Date handling  
- `clsUtil.h` – General utilities  
- `clsInputValidation.h` – Input validation methods

## 🤝 Looking for Internship

I'm currently looking for a **software development internship** to continue growing and apply my skills in a professional environment.

💬 If you know a team or company looking for a motivated developer who values clean code and real software engineering principles, I’d be grateful for any recommendation or advice!
